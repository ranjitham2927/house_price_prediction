House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

Dataset:
- Boston Housing Dataset
- Features used: RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO
- Target variable: PRICE (Median value of owner-occupied homes)

Steps:
1. Loaded and explored the Boston housing dataset.
2. Selected three key features (RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO) for modeling.
3. Applied train-test split.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² score.

Insights:
- RM (average number of rooms) shows a positive influence on price.
- LSTAT (lower income population %) negatively impacts price.
- PTRATIO (student-teacher ratio) inversely affects price.

Conclusion:
Linear regression gives a reasonable baseline model. For improved performance, more features or advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) can be tried.
